\item{analysis}{Either "transport" or "joint".}

\item{K}{Number of folds for cross-fitting (default: 5).}

\item{selection_learner}{Optional ml_learner for selection model.}

\item{propensity_learner}{Optional ml_learner for propensity model (ignored in factual mode).}

\description{
Implements K-fold cross-fitting for nuisance model estimation in
transportability settings. Supports both counterfactual mode (with treatment)
and factual mode (without treatment).
