Description: Provides methods for estimating model performance measures 
    (mean squared error, area under the ROC curve, calibration) under 
    hypothetical/counterfactual interventions. Implements conditional loss, 
    inverse probability weighting, and doubly robust estimators from 
    Boyer, Dahabreh & Steingrimsson (2025) <doi:10.1002/sim.70287>. 
    These methods are essential when prediction models will be deployed 
    in settings where treatment policies differ from training, or when 
    predictions support treatment decisions.
